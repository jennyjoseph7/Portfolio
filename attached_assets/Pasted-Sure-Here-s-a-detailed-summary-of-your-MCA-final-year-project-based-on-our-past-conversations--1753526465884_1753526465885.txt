## **Project Title: AI-Powered Mental Health Tracker with Chatbot Support**

### **Overview:**

The AI-Powered Mental Health Tracker is a mobile application developed using **React Native** for the frontend and **Flask** as the backend framework. This app is designed to help users monitor and improve their mental well-being through various AI-driven and therapeutic features. It combines mood tracking, AI chatbot interaction, music therapy, gamified mental health engagement, and real-time support systems into one integrated platform.

4. **Honor Score System:**

   * A gamified metric to measure user consistency in self-care (e.g., mood logging, journaling, engaging with features).
   * This score affects app privileges like access to certain features.

5. **Music Therapy:**

   * Embedded **relaxing and therapeutic music** sessions (categorized by moods).

### **Pending/Planned Features:**

1. **Wearable Device Integration:**

   * Future integration of **biometric data** (heart rate, sleep, activity) for real-time mental state analysis.

2. **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:**

   * Implement deep learning-based models (e.g., BERT) for more accurate emotion detection in user messages.

3. **App Restriction System:**

   * Temporarily restrict distracting apps when Honor Score is low to promote mental discipline.

4. **Professional Counseling Booking:**

### **Challenges Faced:**

* Managing real-time emotion data while preserving **user privacy**.
* Designing a **non-triggering and empathetic** AI chatbot.
* Ensuring the app remains lightweight while packing several features.
